### Agenda
- Discuss contents of team meeting (Oct 7) with Ritu to get the teaching team on the same page
- Discuss direction of project - using soil and wetlands metadata, removing atacama soil
- Discuss research question involving pH and C:N ratios
   - pH categories will have to be made
- Discuss manifest files, particularily for wetlands metadata
- Discuss merging datasets together for Qiime2 analysis


### Meeting Minutes
- Using the differences in pH, determine if there are any functional differences or any differences in diversity and relate it to the C:N ratio
- To compare differences in pH between environments, we may have to exclude pHs that are not present in both environments
- Can keep environment constant and observe differences in pH in the same environment
  - May have to bring in a different variable if we don't find any differences (Ex C:N ratio)
- Within a dataset, we can see how C:N varies and how it corresponds to diversity
- Discuss with Dr. Sun to see what she thinks about these approaches
- Using taxa bar plot, we can see if we find any differences in function and attribute it to C:N ratio
- Different variable regions means we have to decode variable sequence information in manifest file
- .gz file is used in wetlands dataset â†’ Ritu will ask Dr. Sun how to decode that
- Merging data requires the same variable region
- Can use Qiime to merge datasets and observe diversity
- Devote time to write down aims, list of references and other important points to include in the project proposal (due Oct 20)
- We will have 3 aims: one across datasets with same pH, functional, within one dataset different pH
- Finish wrangling for next meeting and look into Qiime code and start project proposal (due Oct 20)
- Ritu will email us abt manifest, .qz, and .gz files and how to deal with them
