Agenda
- Ask about the length of the introduction section of the draft manuscript
- Ask about where to add an hypthesis or if we can add a research question instead
- Ask about the flow of intro: so far, Introduce C:N, Wetlands/forest soil intro w/ C:N ratio, comparative analysis
- Ask if we include results in the introduction and how in depth we should make the results
- Ask about Log2Fold change:
- We have plots of Log2Fold changes but we dont know if positive or negative fold change represents which category and each plot only shows us 2 categories

Meeting Minutes
- Which group is positive fold change? (it's always alphabetical unless it was set)
- We are working on wetland and soil data set
- Wetland diversity increased as the cn ratio increased
- Soil diversity decreased as the cn ratio increased
- We can put some of the outputs we have on github to follow along
- Soil diversity and clustering is different from the wetland (as expected)
- We did not do any filtering of the data
- We did not do any taxonomic only functional analysis
- High would be a reference
- We found an increase in the antibiotic biosynthesis as the cn ratio increased 
- We have 36 pathways identified in our Log2 Fold graph for soil (6 negative, 30 positive, +/- 1) (high vs low)
(int vs high) (negative = 2, positive = 23, +/- 1)
(int vs low) (negative = 12, positive = 10, +/- 0.5)
+/- 1.5 log fold could be done
- Wetlands:
(high vs low) (negative = 7, positive = 8)
(int vs high) (negative = 4, positive = 0)
(int vs low) (negative = 1, positive = 7)
- Soil is more sensitive to functional changes and to increasing carbon (stress factor for bacteria)
- Explains reduced Faith’s PD
- Bacteria are more ‘happy’ in wetlands because environments is more favorable 
- Higher for soil = more antibiotic synthesis pathways
- Look for pathways involved in stress coping mechanisms in soil data
- Perform DESeq to competent our current findings
- Hope to see a decrease in bacteria in the ‘high’ group
- Could connect which bacteria identified in DESeq are responsible for our identified pathways
- Include information on the two different ecosystems in introduction of manuscript
- The most interesting comparison would be high vs high and low vs low of soil/wetland
- We can put all the figure on a long PowerPoint and figure out what figures to use on our manuscript
- How bacteria cope
- The intro should highlight why this is important
- We tested this hypothesis and this is what we found
- We can add beta diversity, to have a cross-comparison (add ellipsis for the beta diversity plot)
- Colour code the graphs
