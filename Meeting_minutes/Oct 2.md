### Agenda
- Decide on common variables to use between the three datasets (elevation, pH, etc.)
- Ask what TOC is in atacama soil dataset
- What is the difference between SOC and TOC?
- Potential Questions:
-   How do elevation and temperature impact the bacterial community composition and functional traits in soil vs. sand environments?
-   How do moisture content and relative humidity shape microbial functional diversity in soil vs. sand environments?
-   How does the difference in pH between soil and sand samples affect the diversity and functional capabilities of microbial communities?
- Does the presence or absence of vegetation influence the functional diversity of microbial communities in soil vs. sand?
- How does nitrogen and carbon composition of soil vs sand microbiome associate with the ability to grow/rotate crops?
- How does microbial diversity vary with changes in pH across different elevations in arid (Atacama), forest, and wetland ecosystems?
