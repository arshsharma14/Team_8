Agenda 
- Ask about what title we should use for the presentation slides
- Investigate specific pathways that are different across the datasets
- Antibiotic resistant pathways

Meeting Minutes
- Change labels for weighted unifrac so that they are bigger
- Weighted unifrac boxplot should go into Supplemental Figure 1 (S1) Figure 1 (4 panels) (a = soil b = wetlands, c = soil, d = wetlands) and it will be the alpha diversity Faith's PD boxplot (a,b) and Shannon’s Evenness (c,d)
- Can still say that a trend exists in Faith’s PD and C:N ratio in alpha diversity box plot
- Make font bigger and make colors the same for each C:N category for alpha diversity Faith’s PD boxplot
- We may only be able to talk about diversity and functional but not talk about how they are related
- Put functional analysis results (PiCrust) in a Table (soil + wetlands) but don’t cross compare them
- Take high vs low from Log2Fold change (a = soil, b = wetlands) and put it in the Supplemental Figure 2 (S2) as 2 panels (ignore Intermediate here)
- Don't pick any of the pathways specifically 
- PCA results to not be included (the volcano plots)
- Merge the DESeq and PiCrust data together in a table called Table 1
- Reference group is always the lowest group
- The confounding variable may cause the variability
- Limitation: no variable filtering between the 2 datasets even though the samples are very diverse in these datasets so confounders likely has influenced the results
- Soil story go for antibiotics
- The wetland microbes may have the same functions but soil microbes have different functions.
- Can mention that Log2Fold data isn't consistent with DESeq
