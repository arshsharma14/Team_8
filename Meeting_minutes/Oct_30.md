Agenda
- Discuss the old proposal with Ritu and see if she has any recomendations on where to improve for the revised proposal
- Go over the feedback we received on the old proposal
- Ask about the sampling depth for our QIIME analysis

Meeting Minutes
- Provide more background for proposal
- Sampling depth has to be the same for both of our datasets
- We may exclude very low and very high from C:N category
- Sampling depth at 5,086 should be a good approach but we should confirm with Dr. Sun
- Don't start with R analyses yet until we get confirmation about our approach
- Add other factors that can interact with soil microbiome or other studies specific to forest soil or wetlands soil in background
- Mention C:N ratio categories early on in proposal
- In the introduction, make the first sentence connect with the previous paragraph (based on what we talked about in the previous paragraph, we want to answer the question…)
- Don't go into a lot of detail, but menton how we will be using C:N ratio as the independent variable in our studies 
- Can mention extra content in the tables in the table description (such as what “very low” pH means)
- Could mention how we took into account the different variable regions used in the datasets
- Make sure we mention the different species in our study and what metrics we are using in the study
