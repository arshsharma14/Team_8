Agenda
- Ask about sampling depth scross datasets and keeping them consistent to avoid sampling bias
- Ask about merging datasets together and associated code for R analyses
- How to cite Balantine for wetlands dataset - no paper on it and last year group had no specific reference in their bibliography
- Beta diversity analysis of multiple variables 

Meeting Minutes
- Look at the notes and comments on proposal
- Under research objectives, make it explicit what our research question is (bold it or italicize it)
- Ritu found a published paper and will send it to us, but likely not from the same dataset (could cite UJEMI paper or just state the first author)
- Mention no original publication related to the dataset
- Ritu has the code to merge the datasets, she will send it to us
- We donâ€™t have to run the QIIME for merging 
- In conjunction with C:N ratio, we could look at other common variables such as elevation or pH using something like a pCoA plot (to explain differences not accounted for by C:N ratio)
- May turn into a modeling approach as a component of the results of our manuscript
- We will consider this possibility after submission of the proposal. For proposal, we will stick with the 3 aims already mentioned in the proposal
