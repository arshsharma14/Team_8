Agenda
- Propose the new research question to Ritu to get feedback on it
    - Explain how analyzing microbiome via pH bins would not yield significant results
    - Ask if there are any final improvements we should make to the research question (more specific, include more variables, etc.)
- Ask any specific questions we have about the proposal
- Ask about which variable region used for wetlands to be able to find primers for training a classifier

Meeting Minutes 
- Changing our approach to a new research question
- Ritu will ask Evelyn for an extension and turn back as soon as possible
- Another TA will mark the proposal 
- We do not know what variable region used for wetland data, there is no publication of this data set 
- In UJEMI paper the variable region is not mentioned
- We shared the proposal doc with Ritu to see our progress
- We will filter out mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA
- For title, use a title that is like “understanding…in microbial wetlands and soil” or “exploring… in microbial wetlands and soil”
- Mention papers that we read that say we may find differences in our chosen variables (previous literature has shown that…)
