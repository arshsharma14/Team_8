Agenda
- Review the slides we have made so far and ask for any suggestions on how to improve them

Meeting Minutes
- Slide 1: Need a make takeaway title
- Slide 4: Separate out forest & wetlands to make more clear
- Slide 5: 
Need more informative title: C:N ratio
First C:N ratio write out Cario: Nitrogen ratio
More visuals about carbon-nitrogen
- Slide 6 & 7: combine research gap, structure consistency
Microbial diversity in relation to C:N ratio picture from source
- Slide 8: combine with slide 6 & 7?
- Slide 11: 
Literature & sample
Justify binning into categories
- Slide 12: 
Faith’s PD: Phylogenetic distance, richness - only keep A and C
Bigger labels wetlands, soil
Omit slide entirely
- Slide 13: 
Faith’s PD: Phylogenetic distance, richness
Shannon evenness: richness, evenness, abundance
Title reflect result
Just figure, no need for words
More sensitive to CN changes and CN increase makes conditions less favorable for all species (favors some species over others, antibiotic production)
- Slide 14: 
Faith’s PD: Phylogenetic distance, richness
Shannon evenness: richness, evenness, abundance
Make the title reflect results
Wetlands could have more niches to house more bacterial species
High CN ratio allows for more support of species and can balance out diversity of species
- Slide 15: Deseq: increased abundance vs decreases abundance, not upregulation, Refer group 2: reference group, Remove circles/ - distracting elements
- Slide 16: Do not need slide at all, make point in previous slide, Colorcode, highlight table
- Slide 17: 
Reference group mark, 
Change title -> high C:N ratio reduce function diversity in forest, 
Wetlands has functional diversity, Color code, heat map
- Slide 18: 
One conclusion slide
no need for repeat and don’t need to re show figures 
add a discussion to our conclusion section (biological model, antibiotic story)
Happy face vs sad face (one favorable, one volatile), 
divergent response to C:N ratio
- Slide 25: 
Discussion slide, 
what's driving increase, decrease, 
antibiotics, literature, observations, just state for antibiotics (don't show Log2Fold graph)
