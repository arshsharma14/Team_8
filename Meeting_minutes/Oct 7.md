## Meeting w/ Group

- As a group, potential research questions were narrowed down and the metadata files were explored closely to pick out interesting variables and avenues of research
- Decided to focus on using two datasets: "soil" and "wetlands"
- Atacama Soil metadata is not going to be used at this stage

  ### Variables To Consider
  - Decided on some variables of interest: pH and carbon:nitrogen ratio data present in both "soil" and "wetlands" datasets
  - Goal: Group the pH values together based on our criteria to come up with bins like "slighlty acidic, neutral, slightly basic, etc" in order to work with categorical data and not continuous numeric data for ease of wrangling and interpretation
  - Aim: adjusting for pH categories, is there a relationship between carbon:nitrogen ratio and microbial diversity in the samples?
    - also allows for analysis of the kinds of species that are present, as well, and what impact they have on C:N ratio and vice versa

  ### Outcomes of Meeting
  - Began wrangling the data in order to select and remove variables from metadata
  - In the "wetlands" metadata, total carbon and total nitrogen amounts are listed, these values will have to be used in order to calculate C:N ratios
     - new column will be made containing the C:N ratios
  - Wrangling tasks were subdivided amongst the group and everyone downloaded and set up Github Desktop to easily commmit, push, and pull changes
  - Few changes were made to the "soil" metadata file on R together to practice commiting, pushing, and pulling the changes
 
  ### To Do:
  - Create agenda for Wednesday meeting with Ritu
